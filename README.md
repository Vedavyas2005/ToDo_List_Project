**About the Project**

This is a simple yet modern To-Do List desktop app built using Python with a clean CustomTkinter GUI.
I didn’t want just a boring console app — so this one comes with a neat interface, light/dark themes, neon-styled buttons, and everything separated into proper modules for readability and easy maintenance.

The app lets you add, view, update, mark, and delete tasks — with task metadata like priority, category, notes, and timestamps.
It’s small, fast, and lightweight — designed for students, developers, or literally anyone who wants to keep tasks tracked without installing heavy apps.

**✨ Features**

📝 Add Task: Add a task with description, priority (High/Medium/Low), category, and optional notes.

👀 View Tasks: See all tasks in a clean view, with filters (All / Pending / Done) and search by keyword.

✏️ Update Task: Update description, priority, category, or notes for any task.

✅ Mark Done: Mark one or multiple tasks as completed.

❌ Delete Task: Remove tasks you no longer need (with confirmation).

🎨 Themes: Toggle between Dark mode (neon/cherry red) and Light mode (neon blue).

⏱ Timestamps: Each task shows when it was created and last updated.

🔧 Robust Architecture: Logic and GUI separated into different folders for clarity, with each function living in its own file.

**❤️ Why I Built This**

Most “To-Do” projects stop at the console level. I wanted to take it one step further with proper modularity + GUI separation + themes, so it feels like a real desktop app. It’s also structured in such a way that adding persistence (like saving to JSON or DB) would be super easy later.
