## 📖 About the Project
This is a **modern To-Do List desktop app** built using **Python** with a clean and responsive **CustomTkinter GUI**.  
Unlike a basic console-based to-do, this version comes with a neat interface, light/dark themes, neon-styled buttons, and a fully modular folder structure for readability and easy future updates.

The app helps you manage daily tasks with features like adding, viewing, updating, marking, and deleting tasks — with additional metadata such as **priority, category, notes, and timestamps**.  
It’s lightweight, fast, and perfect for students, developers, or anyone looking for a simple personal task manager without installing heavy apps.

## ❤️ Why This Project
Most “to-do” examples stop at the console.  
This project goes beyond with **a modern GUI, themes, and clean modular architecture** — making it feel like a real-world desktop app.  
It’s structured for easy extension too, so adding persistence (JSON/DB) or more advanced features later will be simple.
